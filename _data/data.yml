        As a teaching assistant for CSC-280 (Intro to Computer Science I),
        I am responsible for reviewing and grading studentsâ€™ Python code and teaching
        essential computer science concepts. I am given the opportunity
        to engage one-on-one with students to reinforce concepts taught in class as well as
        debug code. With the opportunity to teach Python, my knowledge of the language has grown
        exponentially. It's hard to teach something if you don't know it inside and out!

        of an intern's role in a team, and I learned alot about how to effectively
        communicatie in a team-setting.
